    <img src="../images/Taco.jpg">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Your ground turkey tacos will have amazing flavor and fewer calories because of the ground turkey! It is a little spicy, but our family enjoys it this way. Because it has so much flavor, you cannot even tell it's not ground beef. It tastes great in tacos or as a topping for baked potatoes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons chili powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>12 ounces ground turkey</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons brown sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Combine chili powder, cumin, paprika, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, and cayenne in a small bowl.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add ground turkey and cook, stirring to break up clumps, until no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Stir in spice mixture and water. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Stir in cider vinegar and brown sugar; simmer until flavors combine, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a serving bowl.</p>
